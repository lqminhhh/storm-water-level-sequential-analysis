# Storm Water Level Sequential Analysis
Author: Minh Le
---

This repository contains code and data for a DA 380 Sequential Analysis final project examining storm driven coastal water level anomalies in San Francisco during an atmospheric river event in early February 2024.

## Project Overview

Coastal water levels are dominated by tidal cycles, but extreme storms can introduce additional forcing. This project analyzes water level anomalies, defined as observed minus predicted tides, to isolate storm related effects and evaluate whether observed deviations represent isolated extremes or sustained changes.

## Methods Used
- Shewhart and CUSUM control charts
- Frequentist mean change detection using PELT
- Bayesian online change point detection
